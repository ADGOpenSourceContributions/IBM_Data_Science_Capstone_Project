# Data Science Example Projects

## House price prediction

Predicting prices of a house, model refinement and evaluation.
[see](https://github.com/kuta-ndze/DScExampleProjects/blob/main/House%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)

## Loan status prediction

Some use cases of classification techniques and evaluation metrics in
Laon status predictions.
[see](https://github.com/kuta-ndze/DScExampleProjects/blob/main/Machine_Learning_With_Python.ipynb)

## Data Collection API for SpaceX

Collecting data via spaceX api, cleaning and prepare for further use.
[see](https://github.com/kuta-ndze/DScExampleProjects/blob/main/Data_Collection_API.ipynb)

Data wrangling checking variable
distribution with value_counts(), writing iterative function to
classify outcome class into binary outcomes of 1 or zero for successful
and unsuccessful landing respectively.
